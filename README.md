# Screenshot-to-webp

Screenshot-to-webp is a Python project created using Streamlit that allows users to take a screenshot of a web page and convert it to the WebP image format. Users can provide the URL of any website, and the application will capture the visible portion of the page and save it as a WebP image file.

This project is still in its early stages, and more features will be added over time. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient way to take screenshots of web pages and convert them to the WebP format, which offers superior compression and quality compared to other image formats.

## Installation

To use the Screenshot-to-webp application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hammaadd/Screenshot-to-webp.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd Screenshot-to-webp
```

Next, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the Screenshot-to-webp application, execute the following command:

```shell
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser. From there, you can enter the URL of the web page you want to capture and convert to WebP. Optionally, you can provide a name for the saved image file.

Click on the "Capture & Convert" button to take the screenshot and convert it to the WebP format. The application will display the captured screenshot, and you will have the option to download the converted image.

## Future Improvements

This project is still in the early stages of development, and there are plans to add more features and improvements in the future. Some of the possible enhancements include:

- Customizable screenshot dimensions
- Support for capturing full-page screenshots
- Batch processing of multiple URLs
- Image editing options (e.g., cropping, resizing)
- Integration with cloud storage services
